## Setting Up the Project

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

GamePulse uses an `.env` file to store sensitive information like database credentials. To set it up:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
2. Open .env in a text editor and update the necessary values, such as database credentials:

   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_NAME=gamepulse
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASS=yourpassword

   The config/env.php file will automatically load these environment variables into your project.

   Note: Do not commit your .env file to Git! It is ignored in .gitignore to keep sensitive data private.

### Database Setup & Migrations

#### Setting Up the Database
Make sure you have MySQL installed and running. Then:

1. Create the database:

   CREATE DATABASE gamepulse;

2. Ensure your .env file has the correct database credentials.

#### Running Migrations
To set up the database structure, we use SQL migration files in the /migrations/ folder.

1. Apply all migrations:

   php scripts/migrate.php

2. If needed, you can apply a specific migration manually:

   mysql -u root -p gamepulse < migrations/001_create_users_table.sql

3. If you make schema changes, create a new SQL migration file in /migrations/ and follow the existing naming convention (001_create_users_table.sql, 002_add_games_table.sql, etc.).
