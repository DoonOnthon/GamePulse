## Short-Term Goals

Our short-term goals for GamePulse include:
- Creating a simple list of games with essential details, such as categories, release dates, and sales numbers.
- Implementing a search functionality to enable users to find specific games easily.
- Designing an intuitive user interface for seamless navigation and discovery.
- Setting up basic community interaction features for users to share their thoughts on games.

## Long-Term Goals

Our long-term goals for GamePulse include:
- Introducing user accounts, enabling users to create profiles and save their favorite games.
- Implementing a user review system to gather valuable feedback and ratings for games.
- Expanding the game database to include a wider range of titles from different platforms and genres.

- Introducing multilingual support to make GamePulse accessible to users from various regions.

## Setting Up the Project

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

GamePulse uses an `.env` file to store sensitive information like database credentials. To set it up:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open .env in a text editor and update the necessary values, such as database credentials:

 ```
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_NAME=gamepulse
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASS=yourpassword
```
   The config/env.php file will automatically load these environment variables into your project.

   Note: Do not commit your .env file to Git! It is ignored in .gitignore to keep sensitive data private.

### Database Setup & Migrations

#### Setting Up the Database
Make sure you have MySQL installed and running. Then:

1. Create the database:
```
   CREATE DATABASE gamepulse;
```
2. Ensure your .env file has the correct database credentials.

#### Running Migrations
To set up the database structure, we use SQL migration files in the /migrations/ folder.

1. Apply all migrations:

   php scripts/migrate.php

2. If needed, you can apply a specific migration manually:
```
   mysql -u root -p gamepulse < migrations/001_create_users_table.sql
```
3. If you make schema changes, create a new SQL migration file in /migrations/ and follow the existing naming convention (001_create_users_table.sql, 002_add_games_table.sql, etc.).
